# Mobile CSS Fix Summary - Slide 3 Text Box Issue

## Problem
The text box from Slide 3 was appearing on ALL slides in mobile view, particularly visible on Slide 1 (hero page). This was caused by generic CSS rules that were applying to all slides instead of being specific to individual slides.

## Root Cause
In the mobile media query (`@media (max-width: 768px)`), there were generic `.content-wrapper` rules that applied styles to ALL slides:

```css
/* PROBLEMATIC CODE - Applied to ALL slides */
.content-wrapper {
    width: calc(100% - 50px);
    max-width: 360px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
    /* ... */
}
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Made CSS Rules Slide-Specific
Instead of generic rules, we now have specific rules for each slide:

```css
/* Only applies to specific slides that need boxes */
#page2 .content-wrapper,
#page4 .content-wrapper,
#page6 .content-wrapper {
    width: calc(100% - 50px);
    max-width: 360px;
    margin: 0 auto;
}
```

### 2. Added Specific Rules for Each Slide

#### Slide 1 (Hero) - No Box
```css
#page1 .content-wrapper {
    background: transparent !important;
    backdrop-filter: none !important;
    padding: 0 !important;
    width: auto !important;
    max-width: none !important;
}
```

#### Slide 3 - Centered Box (as intended)
```css
#page3 .content-wrapper {
    position: relative !important;
    width: calc(100% - 40px);
    max-width: 350px;
    margin: 0 auto !important;
    padding: 1.5rem 1.2rem;
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) !important;
    backdrop-filter: blur(10px) !important;
}
```

#### Other Slides - Individual Specific Rules
Each slide now has its own specific rules preventing style bleeding.

### 3. Used !important Flags
Added `!important` flags to critical properties to ensure slide-specific styles take precedence over any generic rules.

### 4. Added Reset Rule
Added a reset rule to ensure proper positioning:

```css
.page .content-wrapper {
    position: relative;
    z-index: auto;
}
```
