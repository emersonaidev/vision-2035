# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains a converted PDF document about Vision 2035, currently stored as an HTML file generated by pdf2htmlEX.

## Project Structure

```
vision-2035/
└── Vision2035 (2).html  # Large HTML file (55MB) containing converted PDF content
```

## File Details

- **Vision2035 (2).html**: This is a PDF-to-HTML conversion created by pdf2htmlEX. The file contains embedded fonts, styles, and base64-encoded images from the original PDF document.

## Common Development Tasks

Since this appears to be a document repository rather than a code project, typical development tasks might include:

1. **Viewing the document**: Open the HTML file in a web browser
2. **Extracting content**: Parse the HTML to extract text or images
3. **Converting formats**: Convert the HTML back to PDF or other formats if needed

## Notes

- The repository is not currently initialized as a git repository
- The HTML file is quite large (55MB) due to embedded resources from the PDF conversion
- The file uses inline CSS and base64-encoded fonts/images typical of pdf2htmlEX output
