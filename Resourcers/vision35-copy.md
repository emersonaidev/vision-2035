## A PLACE LIKE NO OTHER
Necker Island.
A privilege to be here. A private island. A source of energy.

## A sanctuary for deep thought.
Sir Richard Branson’s legendary retreat ­ – a meeting point for world-changers,
visionaries, entrepreneurs, and peacemakers. Here, the foundation of The
Elders was laid, and the sanctuary of the Elders Temple was created to
host gatherings: Desmond Tutu. Nelson Mandela. Jimmy Carter. They didn’t
come for an event. They came to shape the future. Not in meetings. But in
moments that last forever.

## NOW, YOU STEP INTO
THIS CIRCLE.
Together with fourty extraordinary people from
across the globe, ready to write history – their
own, their families’, and their companies’.
Not to consume.
But to create.
Will you be a part of this movement?

## MORE THAN A MASTERMIND
This is not a retreat. It’s a departure. An alliance.
An exclusive future lab under the palms – for entrepreneurs, visionaries,
creators, and family-driven leaders who understand: The next decade
won’t be “business as usual.”
That’s why this calls for something different.
Far from the noise. Close to your essence.

## WHY NECKER ISLAND
CHANGES EVERYTHING
It’s more than turquoise waters, soft winds, and
the freedom of barefoot luxury.
It’s the energy.
The blend of wild nature, vibrant history, and an
environment designed to expand your mind and
open your heart.
Tennis in symbiosis with the ocean breeze.
Feeding lemurs.
Laughing with flamingos.
Up-close moments with giant tortoises.
Kite surfing.

## THIS IS WHERE TRUE
CONNECTION HAPPENS
This is where true connection happens — because you’re invited to be
fully human, not just your title.
Do you want to experience how lightness creates depth?

## THE CIRCLE OF TRUST
In times when much around us is falling apart,
something lasting is created here:
Trust. Connection. Depth.
Not through business cards.
But through genuine encounters.
People who, in turbulent times, don’t run from
the storm – they navigate it.
For themselves.
For their families.
For a future that matters.

## VISION 2035.
NECKER ISLAND.
THE IGNITION.
THIS IS YOUR MOMENT You don’t want to wait for “someday” for the
future to arrive?
Because the future doesn’t just happen.
It’s created.
By people like you.
At places like Necker.
With clarity. Joy. Courage.
And the right people by your side.
ARE YOU READY TO
TAKE THE FIRST STEP?
Speak with us – personally, directly.
Because what begins here can’t be googled.
It can only be experienced.
Now is the moment.
